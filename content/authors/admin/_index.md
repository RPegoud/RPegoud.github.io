I'm a recent graduate from __UCL__'s _Computational Statistics and Machine Learning program_. My research interests center around __Natural Language Processing__ (NLP), __Reinforcement Learning__ (RL) and __Multi-Agent Systems__. 
Previously, I was a module leader and lecturer in NLP at EPF Engineering School and an independent researcher in RL. 
I completed an MEng in Computer Engineering at EPF Engineering School, duringh which I worked as a Data Scientist at BMW and CEWE.
