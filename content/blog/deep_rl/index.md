## Summary

Recent progress in Reinforcement Learning (RL), such as Waymo‚Äôs autonomous taxis or DeepMind‚Äôs superhuman chess-playing agents, complement **classical RL** with **Deep Learning** components such as **Neural Networks** and **Gradient Optimization methods**.

Building on the foundations and coding principles introduced in one of my previous stories, we‚Äôll discover and learn to implement **Deep Q-Networks** (DQN) and **replay buffers** to solve OpenAI‚Äôs CartPole environment. All of that in under a second using **JAX**!

This article will cover the following sections:
- Why do we need Deep RL?
- Deep Q-Networks, theory and practice
- Replay Buffers
- Translating the CartPole environment to JAX
- The JAX way to write efficient training loops
