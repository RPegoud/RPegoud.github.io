## Summary

In 2013, the introduction of **Deep Q-Networks** (DQN) by *Mnih et al.* marked the first breakthrough in Deep Reinforcement Learning, surpassing expert human players in three Atari games. Over the years, several variants of DQN were published, each improving on specific weaknesses of the original algorithm. 

In 2017, _Hessel et al._ made the best out of the DQN palette by combining 6 of its powerful variants, crafting what could be called the DQN Megazord: **Rainbow**.

In this article, weâ€™ll break down the individual components that make up Rainbow, while reviewing their **JAX** implementations in the **Stoix** library.
