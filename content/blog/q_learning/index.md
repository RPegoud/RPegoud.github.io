## Summary

In this article, we’ll see how to **scale up RL experiments** by **vectorizing environments** and seamlessly **parallelizing** the **training of dozens of agents** using **JAX**. In particular, this article covers:

- JAX basics and useful features for RL
- Vectorized environment and why they are so fast
- Implementation of an environment, policy, and Q-learning agent in JAX
- Single-agent training
- How to parallelize agent training, and how easy it is!
